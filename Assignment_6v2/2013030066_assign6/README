Assignment 6
to run the monitor, first use "make" command, then execute with "sudo ./monitor -X xxx", 
where X is argument (h for help message, i for interface capture or r for file reading) and xxx is option (interface name or file name)
to exit, use ctrl+c
the program captures packets and prints an update on how many packets have been captured once a second.
packet information are saved in the "log.txt" file
upon exit, the program prints total session stats

question 9: Can you tell if an incoming TCP packet is a retransmission? If yes, how? If not, why?
it should possible to find retransmissions through a combination of ack number, sequence number and timestamps. 
i didn't have enough time to implement it

question 10: Can you tell if an incoming UDP packet is a retransmission? If yes, how? If not, why?
UDP by itself doesn't do retransmissions. it's up to the individual application to deal with retransmissions.
therefore we cannot reliably tell which packets are retransmissions

question 11: In your program (when possible), mark each retransmitted packet as “Retransmitted”
not implemented.

comments on code should suffice as an explanation of how code functions
